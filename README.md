# Scorekeeper

This project uses vanilla Javascript to count the score of player 1 and player 2 with respect to the button being pressed. The reset button resets the score while the finish button shows us the winner or the player with the highest score. The idea was to use Event listeners to keep tab of scores.

I'm a front-end developer aiming to build projects that can add value as well as to learn something new every day. 


## Lessons Learned

The main purpose was to use logic to build this basic web app which can keep tabs of the score and at the end shows which player has the greater score. To kickstart the project it was tough to build the base logic of the project.
